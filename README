GNU/Linux bootable initrd image for implementing a torrent server.

This uses the btpd daemon but perhaps in the future it may use rtorrent or
a libtorrent variant, to support magnet links.

The idea is to boot up remotely over a network and then mount a larger 2tb+
storage drive, for serving up torrent files. No authentication is introduced
here so it is up to the surrounding network or management layer to determine
which .torrent files make it onto or off the server.

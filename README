GNU/Linux bootable initrd image for implementing a torrent server.

This uses the btpd daemon but perhaps in the future it may use rtorrent or
a libtorrent variant, to support magnet links.

The idea is to boot up remotely over a network and then mount a larger 2tb+
storage drive, for serving up torrent files. No authentication is introduced
here so it is up to the surrounding network or management layer to determine
which .torrent files make it onto or off the server.


You want to make sure you add torrent_server=ad.dr.re.ss to your kernel
command line options (as part of your pxelinux configuration) in the APPEND=
block for the included init script to start the btpd daemon with a proper
public facing IP address.

It's a good idea to give it the IP so that regardless of whether the software
is run on a private address space, it will still broadcast the true public
facing IP.


You want to put an injections/authorized_keys2 file in place with a couple
of your ssh public keys (~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub contents) so that you can log
into the system, once it boots.

Also specify env/output_img to contain the path name to the initrd image
to output as the first line of that file.
